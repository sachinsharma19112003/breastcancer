## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–based web application that predicts whether a breast tumor is **Benign (Non-Cancerous)** or **Malignant (Cancerous)** using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

The application is built and deployed using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive interface where users can dynamically adjust the value of **K** and evaluate model performance in real-time.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow:

* Data preprocessing
* Feature scaling
* Model training
* Performance evaluation
* Visualization
* Web deployment

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection significantly increases survival rates.

The objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of predicting tumor diagnosis using structured medical features.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple features computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.

### 🔎 Important Features:

* Radius
* Texture
* Perimeter
* Area
* Smoothness
* Compactness
* Concavity
* Symmetry
* Fractal Dimension

### 🎯 Target Variable:

* **0 → Benign**
* **1 → Malignant**

### 🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps:

* Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., ID)
* Applied Label Encoding to diagnosis column
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

Dataset loaded using Pandas.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed irrelevant columns.

### 3️⃣ Encoding

Converted categorical diagnosis values to numerical format.

### 4️⃣ Train-Test Split

* 80% Training Data
* 20% Testing Data

### 5️⃣ Feature Scaling

Applied StandardScaler because KNN is distance-based.

### 6️⃣ Model Training

Used Scikit-learn’s `KNeighborsClassifier`.

### 7️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

### 8️⃣ Visualization

Plotted **Accuracy vs K** graph to identify optimal K value.

### 9️⃣ Model Saving

Saved trained model as:

```
breast.pkl
```
